🚖 RideAway – Scalable Ride-Hailing Backend Platform
RideAway is a modern, extensible ride-hailing backend platform built using ASP.NET Core (.NET 6). This project is designed and implemented by a graduate developer passionate about scalable architecture, clean code, and modern development practices. The backend system provides core functionalities like fare estimation, ride management, and real-time tracking, forming a solid foundation for a full-featured ride-hailing application.

📌 Project Overview
This is an ongoing, actively developed project, designed not only as a portfolio piece but also as a real-world demonstration of Clean Architecture principles in a production-grade backend service. It demonstrates best practices in ASP.NET Core API development, Domain-Driven Design, and SOLID principles.

The project aims to:

Provide a flexible and testable backend architecture

Support essential ride-hailing features (e.g., fare estimation, location tracking, ride matching)

Allow for seamless extension and scaling

Promote clean separation of concerns and domain encapsulation

🧠 Architecture Overview
RideAway follows the Clean Architecture / Onion Architecture pattern, with clear boundaries between layers:

Layers:
API Layer (Presentation)

Handles incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses

Responsible for routing, validation, and serialization

Application Layer

Contains service interfaces and business logic orchestration

Implements core use cases like fare calculation and ride matching

Domain Layer

Core domain models (e.g., Location, RideCategory)

Contains value objects and business rules

Infrastructure Layer (Planned/Expandable)

For persistence, external services, etc.

Currently stubbed with in-memory services

🔍 Detailed Code Walkthrough
FareController.cs
The FareController is a RESTful API controller, decorated with:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
This enables automatic model binding, routing, and validation.

⭐ Key Responsibilities:
Handles fare estimation requests

Utilizes constructor injection to receive:

IFareCalculationService

IRideMatchingService

🧮 Estimate Fare Endpoint:
(Currently commented for future use or testing)

Accepts a FareEstimationDTO via HTTP POST

Delegates calculation logic to IFareCalculationService

Inputs: pickup location, destination, estimated distance and duration

Outputs: estimated fare as part of the HTTP response

🧩 Domain and DTOs:
Location, RideCategory, FareEstimationDTO represent domain models and data transfer objects

Promotes a clean separation between the external API contract and internal business logic

✅ Best Practices Followed
🔄 Dependency Injection for loosely coupled services

🧪 Testable Codebase via interface-driven development

📚 SOLID Principles for maintainable architecture

🔒 Separation of Concerns: controller, logic, and data layers

💡 Domain-Driven Design with entities and value objects

🧪 Getting Started
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rideaway.git
cd rideaway
Run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet run
Access Swagger UI:

Navigate to http://localhost:5000/swagger for interactive API docs.

Test endpoints (add your own API key if necessary).

⚠️ API Key Notice
🚨 IMPORTANT:
If you are testing with an external service or integrating your own APIs (e.g., maps, location services), please add your API keys in your local environment or config files.

DO NOT commit sensitive information or credentials to the repository.
Always remove or mask keys before pushing to GitHub for security reasons.

👨‍💻 Personal Note
This project reflects my personal growth and love for backend engineering. As a recent graduate, I'm committed to applying real-world principles and learning through building. RideAway is not just a coding exercise—it's a long-term project I intend to evolve with:

New features (real-time driver tracking, payment integration, ride matching algorithm)

Performance optimizations

Unit and integration test coverage

Possible front-end and mobile client integrations
